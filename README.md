# Introduction

It is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

You can read more about it at [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). <br>

## Technologies

It is written in **native** `Javascript` and uses `HTML5` and `CSS3` for the UI with no external library or framework. <br> 
The UI is based on the [playfameoflife.com](http://playgameoflife.com/) website. <br>
